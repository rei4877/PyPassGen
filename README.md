Random string generator made with Python

This is just a simple "Password" generator I built while learning Python. Generated "passwords" are just a random bunch of strings

# Installation

_Requires Python 3_

Download the *PyPassGen.py*, and copy/move the file to a folder.

# How to Use

## 1. Run PyPassGen.py

Self-explainatory

## 2. Amount of passwords to be generated

The number inputted will determine how many passwords will be generated.

_Input a number, then press Enter_
    
## 3. Length of the password

The number inputted will determine how many characters each generated passwords have.

_Input another number, then press Enter_

## 4. Passwords generated!
Generated password will be shown on screen.

They will be automatically exported as *PyPassGen - Passwords.txt* in the same folder as the \*.py file
